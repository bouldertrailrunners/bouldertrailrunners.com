title: Community Guidelines
---

_These guidelines were last updated in April 2024 at the yearly managers meeting._

- What is Boulder Trail Runners? BTR is a community of groups, centered around running trails in Boulder and facilitated by the email list.
  - BTR Email List will have 3 Group Owners: The three longest serving active leaders, trusted to hold group ownership, and updated at the yearly meeting: Charles, Vanessa, and Nate
  - Owners should do nothing, but be trustworthy to hold the keys to the email list.

- User moderation:
  - By default, all users are moderated (emails to the group must be approved).
  - All run leaders are unmoderated on the email list.
  - Managers should allow any email through that fits the email guidelines.
  - All users should be allowed to join, as long as they are not spam accounts.
  - The email list should be public.

- Facebook page
  - The facebook page should be there to direct people to the email list.
  - Designate someone to manage the Facebook page at the yearly meeting. (Vanessa)

- Yearly meeting
  - The run leaders should meet yearly in the spring to discuss group guidelines.
  - After the yearly meeting, we can update the managers list to current active run leaders who are interested.

- Email guidelines
  - Email should be about running and events. “Anything that supports the spirit of runners and running”
  - No solicitation. No Ads. Except when it directly advertises a local running event that would appeal to the membership.
  - To discuss a pending email, discuss with bouldertrailrunners+managers@groups.google.com

- New Runs
  - Anyone who wants to lead a run can lead one.
  - A manager should unmoderate the account as soon as we see the intent to lead a run.

- Run Email Suggestions
  - Set the time and place of your run.
  - Please add a link to the trailhead
  - Mention the pace (no-drop or paced)

- Handling Conflict
  - If it is limited to a single run, it should be managed by the leaders of that run, with a notification to the managers list of any decision if relevant.
  - If the conflict is larger, the managers email list is an appropriate place to discuss a response.
  - If the conflict requires a meeting, the managers can setup an ad hoc meeting to discuss a response.
  - If the conflict needs to be resolved with a downgrade of email list permissions, this should be accompanied with an email/discussion to the managers list and a direct response to the user being downgraded.
