Boulder Trail Runners (commonly referred to as **BTR**) is a group of runners who organize runs in and around Boulder. Anyone, of any speed, is welcome.

## How to Join

Our runs are posted on a Google Group email list. To receive the emails, you must join the group (it's free and easy). Simply email <a href="mailto:bouldertrailrunners+subscribe@googlegroups.com">BoulderTrailRunners+subscribe@googlegroups.com</a> from your email and you will automatically be subscribed to future emails. If you join from a google account, you can also access the Google group web interface at [groups.google.com/g/bouldertrailrunners](https://groups.google.com/g/bouldertrailrunners) to view past announcements.

## Signature Runs

Anyone can organize runs on the BTR email list, but there are a few long-running signature runs we're known for:

### Happy Hour Run - Thursdays @ 5:30PM

The Happy Hour Run (or HHR) is the longest continuously hosted group run in Boulder (at least we're pretty sure about that). It was originally founded in the 90s by the founding members of Boulder Trail Runners. It is held rain or shine. Cancellations are so few and far between that they are talked about for years afterwards.

HHR is hosted by a rotating list of 5-8 runner-leaders. Each run is 60-90 minutes, no-drop, accepting all paces. Meeting location and route varies week-to-week. Sometimes it's flat and fast, sometimes it's off trail. Depends on the host and the week.

Afterwards (around 7PM), we usually head to Sherpa's Adventure Restaurant and Bar for dinner and drinks.

If you would like to become an HHR leader, please email the [Managers](mailto:bouldertrailrunners+manager@googlegroups.com).

### Night Run - Tuesdays @ 8:30PM

The Night Run is a long-held weekly dark run on various trails around Boulder.

### Wednesday Morning Run(s) - Wednesdays @ 5:30AM and 7AM

Two different groups meet for Wednesday morning runs. Early group at 5:30AM and later group (hosted by Vanessa) at 7AM. Both are fun!

### Church of the Holy Long Run - All Day Sundays

The most infamous run in Boulder: The Church of the Holy Long Run. Originally and continuously hosted by Fred Ecks. If you attend Church, don't plan on doing anything else that day. Runs are long, epic, and awesome. Pace is slow-ish. Bring food.
